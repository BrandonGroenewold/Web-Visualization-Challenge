# Unit 11 Homework: Web Visualization Dashboard 

- In VS code create an HTML file for index, comparison, data, table, one for each weather group (cloudiness, humidity, temperature, and windspeed) and places to store your css and images

### Create a nav bar
- On the index page create a nav bar that will easily navigate you to each page you wish to go. Ex. Cloudiness.html to view the cloud data.
- Once you are done make sure to add it to the other pages so you can still navigate to which ever page you wish.

### Content
- Create a header and write a short analysis on each page describing the data that is displayed.
- For each plot page add a graph and showcase the plots on the side so you can get a preview and click on another to view other weather data.

### Table of Data
- Import the csv and add a table of the data to it. This way all the data collected can be displayed.

### CSS
- Add any css you may need to make the page fit your preference.
